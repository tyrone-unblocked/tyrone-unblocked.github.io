          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Privacy Policy was last updated on Jan 1 2018.

Data collection and its purposes Our servers automatically recognize visitors’ domain names and IP addresses (the number assigned to computers on the Internet). The Io Games Site may gather anonymous “traffic data" that does not personally identify you, but that data may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer.

Such usage information includes information about how our visitors use and navigate the Io Games Site.

Third party games This Privacy Policy does not apply to the processing of personal data by data controllers other than Io Games, such as providers of third party games available on the Io Games Site. The relevant provider of such a third party game is responsible for ensuring that any processing of personal data by them in the context of a game complies with applicable data protection laws. Generally, Io Games does not permit third party content providers to collect personal data about Users. However, if any personal data will be collected by a third party content provider, Io Games will contractually require that the processing of personal data by them in the context of a game complies with applicable data protection laws. 5.

If you have any questions about our policy regarding international data transfers, please contact us at support@github.io 9. Children Users We recognize the importance of safeguarding the privacy of children and encourage parents to check and monitor their children’s use of online activities regularly. This is why we created a separate age-appropriate experience for Children Users through the Io Games Kids Site, or through an age-gate in certain games on the Io Games General Site: in order to comply with the legislation, you could be presented to an age screen when starting the game. When presented with this age screen, it is important that you state the correct age. Based on your age information and your device settings, Io Games does not process personal data of children under the minimum age limit (Children Users) that is prescribed by the legislation in the individual jurisdictions for behavioral advertisement. The Children Users’ experience of games with an age-gate on the Io Games General Site, and the Io Games Kids Site supports and complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA"). The Children Users’ experience of games with an age-gate on the Io Games General Site and the Io Games Kids site will not request any personal information from Children Users. There is no registration required for the Io Games Kids Site and any advertising shown on the Io Games Kids Site, or in the the Children Users’ experience of games with an age-gate on the Io Games General Site, is age-appropriate. The Io Games Kids Site and the Children Users’ experience of games with an age-gate on the Io Games General Site will not show behaviorally targeted ads or allow third parties to track the activity of Children Users for that purpose. The Io Games Kids Site and the the Children Users’ experience of games with an age-gate on the Io Games General Site may collect and use IP addresses and other persistent identifiers, including cookies, from Children Users, but only for purposes of supporting our internal operations, such as to help us: Identify whether you are a child or adult for data protection purposes to determine the legal requirements for our processing of your data Maintain or analyze the functioning of the Io Games Kids Site Perform network communications Authenticate users of, or personalize the content on, the Io Games Kids Site Serve contextual advertising on the Io Games Kids Site and cap the frequency of advertising We have separated our platform into a few sections. Io Games Kids was created for our youngest audience and is fully COPPA compliant. If you are a Child User, you should only use the Io Games Kids Site and only with the permission of a parent or legal guardian. On Io Games.com, you’ll find games that are intended at users that are over 13. Io Games.com is not targeted towards children under the age of 13 and it will not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. To learn more about COPPA, please reference this simple one-page informational guide from the kidSAFE Seal Program: https://www.kidsafeseal.com/knowaboutcoppa.html. 10. Lawful Bases for Processing Personal Data If you are an individual in the European Union (EU), we collect and process data about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws. This means we collect and process your data only when: It is necessary for a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your individual privacy interests), such as preventing fraud, improving the Service, and increasing the security of the Service and network infrastructure; You have consented to this collection and processing for a specific purpose; It is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations; or It is necessary to comply with a legal obligation. Where we rely on our legitimate interests to process your personal data, you have the right to object. More information on exercising this right can be found in section 11 addressing Individual Rights. Some examples of our legitimate interests and the data being processed include: Network and information security (IP address, user/device ID) Customer Support and fraud prevention (email address) Improving our products and services (activity logs) Where we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw or decline consent at any time. If you wish to withdraw your consent, please contact us using the information in section 12 regarding the Contacts for Individual Rights Requests. If you have any questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal data, please contact us at ahrefdd@gmail.com. 11. Individual Rights Io Games makes certain choices available to you when it comes to your personal data. Please review the below information outlining your choices and how to exercise them. We will respond to all requests within a reasonable timeframe. If our full response will ever take more than a month due to complexity or scope, we will notify you of this and keep you updated. We may request more information to confirm your identity before acting on any request. Review and update your data: You have the right to access and update any personal data that we have collected. To review or update this data, please submit a request using the contact information at the end of this section. Delete your data: You also hold the right to have your personal data deleted. This is sometimes known as the ‘right to be forgotten’. To request that we delete all personal data about you, please submit a request using the contact information at the end of this section. After you delete your personal data from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not immediately remove data from our backup systems for archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so. We may also decline to honor this request in certain specific situations, such as if the data is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or to exercise/defend a legal claim. Restrict Processing: You have the right to restrict how we process your personal data in certain circumstances. This is an alternative to requesting the deletion of your data. Rather than requesting we delete all of your personal data, you may request that we limit our uses of your personal data to specific purposes. You may wish to request we restrict our processing if you contest the accuracy of your personal data and we are working to verify this information, or if you want us to retain your personal data in connection to a legal claim but cease processing it. Data Portability: You have the right to obtain copies of your information in a structured, commonly used format that you can move your data between our service and the services of others. We may request more information to confirm your identity before providing any personal data. Right to Object: You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes or when our processing of your data is based on legitimate interests. You may request that we stop processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. This is an absolute right and we cannot refuse this request. Beyond direct marketing, if you wish to exercise this right, you must give specific reasons why you object to our processing of your data, based on your particular situation. Even after receiving such a request, we may continue processing if it is necessary for the exercise/defense of a legal claim or if we can demonstrate a compelling legitimate ground for the processing. If any request made under this section is clearly unfounded or excessive, we may reject the request or require a reasonable fee to honor the request. If we decide to reject your request, we will inform you of the reasons for not taking action and provide information on other possible remedies. If we decide that a reasonable fee is necessary, we will promptly inform you and will comply with the request upon receipt of this fee. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
